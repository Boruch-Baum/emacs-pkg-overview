# pkg-overview.el - Make org documentation from elisp source file

## Commentary:

This package parses an elisp file's comments, definitions,
docstrings, and other documentation into a hierarchical `org-mode`
buffer. It is intended to facilitate familiarization with a file's
contents and organization / structure. The viewer can quickly swoop
in and out and across the file structure using standard `org-mode`
commands and keybindings.

## Dependencies:

`org`: For `org-mode` (should be bundled in your Emacs already)

## Installation:

1) Evaluate or load this file.

## Interactive operation:

Interactive function M-x `pkg-overview` prompts the user for an elisp
file, parses it according to generally accepted elisp formatting
conventions, and generates a read-only `org-mode` buffer with the
results.

:checkered_flag: Note: If you haven't yet loaded feature `org-mode`,
you will experience a delay the first time you evaluate function
`pkg-overview` as *it* performs the load.

## Configuration:

None.

## Compatibility

Tested with Emacs 27.1 and `org-mode` 9.4.6. in Debian.
