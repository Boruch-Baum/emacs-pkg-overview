;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package parses an elisp file's comments, definitions,
;; docstrings, and other documentation into a hierarchical `org-mode'
;; buffer. It is intended to facilitate familiarization with a file's
;; contents and organization / structure. The viewer can quickly swoop
;; in and out and across the file structure using standard `org-mode'
;; commands and keybindings.

;;
;;; Dependencies (all are already part of Emacs):
;;
;;   org -- for `org-mode'

;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; 1) Evaluate or load this file.
;;
;; 2) I don't expect anyone who would want to define a global
;;    keybinding for this kind of function needs me to tell them how
;;    do so, but I'm mindlessly filling out my own template, so:
;;
;;      (global-set-key (kbd "S-M-C F1 M-x butterfly C-c C-h ?") 'pkg-overview)

;;
;;; Operation:
;;
;; Interactive function `pkg-overview' prompts the user for an elisp
;; file, parses it according to generally accepted elisp formatting
;; conventions, and generates a read-only `org-mode' buffer with the
;; results.
;;
;; Note that as of Emacs version 27 and `org-mode' version 9.4.6,
;; `org-mode' takes what some people find to be unbearable entire
;; seconds to load. If you find yourself distressed by this, please:
;; relax; take long, slow, deep breaths, and; be consoled that the
;; gratification-delay only occurs the first time `org-mode' is used
;; for any session.

;;
;;; Feedback:
;;
;; It's best to contact me by opening an 'issue' on the program's github
;; repository (see above) or, distant second-best, by direct e-mail.
;;
;; Code contributions are welcome and github starring is appreciated.

;;
;;; Compatibility
;;
;; This package has been tested under Debian linux Emacs version 27
;; and `org-mode' version 9.4.6.

;;; Emacs-core integration notes
;;
;; This package was originally proposed on the `emacs-devel' mailing
;; list as a new feature for emacs-core[1]. See there for the 30
;; messages of the thread. Here's a summary of the demands made in
;; that thread as a pre-requisite for it to be considered for
;; inclusion:
;;
;; + Use `outline-minor-mode' instead of `org-mode'
;;   + org-mode takes an "excessive" time to load. (Stefan Monnier)
;;   + At the time, `outline-minor-mode' wasn't available to the public,
;;     but when it was released I did implement this and found it very
;;     confusing and burdensome because of all the different keybindings
;;     it needed to perform what `org-mode' does with a single keybinding
;;     (<TAB>).
;;   + Initially, and until I hear complaints, I'm willing to wave my
;;     hands and baselessly claim that people who want to use this kind
;;     of feature already have `org-mode' loaded, so it's not an issue.
;;     + If it becomes a deal-breaker, I could add a defcustom to
;;       optionally select the mode to be used.
;;     + It `outline-minor-mode' becomes as easy to use as `org-mode',
;;       and with compatible keybindings, I'd be happy to make it the
;;       exclusive presentation mode.
;;
;; + This feature should not be a stand-alone feature
;;   + It should be integrated into the output produced by function
;;     `describe-package' (Eli Zaretskii, Stefan Monnier, Stefan Kangas)
;;   + I'm open to the idea of integrating the feature, but not at the
;;     expense of being independently discoverable.
;;     + The feature is intended to be useful for elisp files even if
;;       they aren't loaded packages.
;;
;; + Formatting demands (Stefan Kangas)
;;   + Don't show obsolete aliases.
;;   + Improve representation of autoload cookies
;;   + Apply function `substitute-command-keys' to doc strings
;;   + Re-arrange the author's organization of the file
;;     + eg. Move the license to the end, or omit it.

;; [1] 2020-10-15 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01265.html


;;; TODO:
;;
;; + The single \t inserted into "(def[^ ]+" headings in insufficient
;;   to vertically align symbol names when the "(def[^ ]+" is
;;   `define-derived-mode' or `define-obsolete-function-alias'
;;
;; + Argument lists that extend to a second line are being truncated
;;
;; + Variable definitions that are functions are not being truncated
;;
;; + Some defun's are not having their ( deleted
;;   + eg. w3m.el: w3m-header-arguments
;;
;; + Prefacatory comments to a function appear under the preceding heading
;;   + eg. w3m.el: w3m-header-arguments

;;; pkg-overview.el ends here
